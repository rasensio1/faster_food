# Faster Food

##### [Justin Holzmann](#), [Michael Wong](#), [Ryan Asensio](https://github.com/rasensio1)

Faster Food was our group's first taste of a real Ruby on Rails app at the [Turing School](http://turing.io). Groups are tasked to build an e-commerce store and implement any additional features that interest them.

Our group's application is a designed to be a whitelabel experience for restaurants who want their food delivered by drone. We integrated a the Twilio and Stripe APIs, as well as a simple API that calculates straight-line distance from a given address.
